# Algorithm_Trade


The algorithm trading app is a python jupyter lab interface program.  It  uses various machine learning models and techniques to train and evaluate, and himprove the existing algorithmic trading systems and maintain the firmâ€™s competitive advantage in the market. This app enhances the existing trading signals with machine learning algorithms that can adapt to new data.

## Model Evaluation and Conclusion

1. Base Support Vector Machine Model:  The base model has 55% accruacy prediction.  The recall of signal -1 is only 4%.  It means that of total actuals as signal -1, the model only predicts 4% accurately. For signal 1, the precision, recall, f1-score are good.  The strategy cumulative returns outperforms the actual cumulative returns.

2. Support Vector Machine Model 1 - The model with increaseing training window to 20-month has accuracy rate higher than original model by 2%.  However, the signal -1 recall drops in new model.  For signal 1, F1-score, recall, precision rates are better than the base model.  The cumulative return performs better in base model and actual returns.

3. Support Vector Machine model 2 - The model with change of short window to 30 and long window to 120 has accuracy rate higher than original model by 1%. While the singal 1 recall rate increases a little, the singal -1 recall rated drops slightly as well.  The model 2 cumulative return is lower than the actual cumulative return and is also lower than the original model cumulative return even though the model 2 accuracy rate is higher than base model.

4. Support Vector Machine model 3 - The model with change of training windows as 10-month, short window to 3 and long window to 120 has accuracy rate higher than original model by 1%. While the singal 1 recall rate increases a little, the singal -1 recall rated drops slightly as well.  The model 3 cumulative return is lower than the actual cumulative return even though the model 3 accuracy rate is higher than base model.

5. Logistic Regression model - The accuracy rate is lower than the base model.  This model has highest the recall rates/precision/f1-score for signal -1.  Cumulative strategy returns is the lower than the actual cumulative returns and lowest among all of the models.

## Technologies

This project leverages python 3.7 with the following packages:

* [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html) - It's a server-client application that allows editing and running notebook documents via a web browser.

* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/index.html) - For Series, DataFrame, and plots

* [numpy](https://numpy.org/) - For adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays

* [pathlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) -For object-oriented filesystem paths 

* [%matplotlib inline](https://pythonguides.com/what-is-matplotlib-inline/#:~:text=What%20is%20matplotlib%20inline%20in%20python%20IPython%20provides,two%20types%20of%20magic%20functions%2C%20line-oriented%20and%20cell-oriented.) - For Cell-oriented magic functions

* [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) - For Simple and efficient tools for predictive data analysis.


## Installation Guide

Before running the application first install the following dependencies.

```python
  pip install pandas
  pip install jupyterlab
  pip install -U scikit-learn
```

## Usage

To use the algorithm trading app, simply clone the `algorithm_trading from the respository, open jupyter lab and open **machine_learning_trading_bot.ipynb** with:

```python
jupyter lab
```

Re-run the jupyter book to produce learning prediction.
